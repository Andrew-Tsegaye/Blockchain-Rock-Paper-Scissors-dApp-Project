# Echo DApp Front-end

This project is a simple example on how to implement a Cartesi DApp front-end.
It is a specific client for the "Rock-Paper-Scissors" application.

It is implemented as a regular ReactJS application, using [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/) and [apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) as its main dependencies.

## Building

Simply execute the following command from the project's directory:

```shell
yarn
```

## Running

```shell
yarn start
```

This will execute the front-end application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
